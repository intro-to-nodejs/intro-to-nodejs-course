# Node.js Potential Next Steps

## Enhance Node.js Performance & Scalability

Learn how to use [clustering](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html), [child processes](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html), and [worker threads](https://blog.insiderattack.net/deep-dive-into-worker-threads-in-node-js-e75e10546b11) to enable parallel, CPU-intensive JavaScript operations in Node.js.

## Dive Deeper into Node.js's Event-Driven Architecture

Learn about the Event Loop, callbacks, promises, `async`/`await`, and event-emitters.

Read about Node.js's [module architecture](https://itnext.io/deep-dive-into-node-js-module-architecture-b80fbd22dacb).

## Test your Node.js Application

[Test](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2020/01/27/best-nodejs-testing-tools) both synchronous and asynchronous code.

## Learn about Node.js Security

Learn how to enhance [application security, error & exception handling, and the overall security of your Node.js server and platform](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Nodejs_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html). Take a look at these Node.js [security packages](https://github.com/lirantal/awesome-nodejs-security).

## Learn about other Node.js Frameworks

Express is a popular Node.js framework but [it is not the only one that exists](https://github.com/intro-to-nodejs/intro-to-nodejs-course/blob/master/readmes/intro-to-express.md#other-nodejs-frameworks--tools).

## Other Ideas

- Write [Node.js in TypeScript](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/09/19/nodejs-typescript)
- Node.js is a popular choice for building [microservices](https://nodesource.com/blog/microservices-in-nodejs)
- Work with [buffers](https://nodejs.dev/learn/nodejs-buffers) and [streams](https://nodejs.dev/learn/nodejs-streams).
